The "Analyzing the Impact of Workplace Factors on Employee Mental Health" project explores how various occupational and personal factors contribute to mental health challenges. The dataset includes demographic (Gender, Country, Occupation), psychological (Growing Stress, Coping Struggles, Mood Swings, Mental Health History), and behavioral factors (Days Indoors, Work Interest, Changes in Habits) that may influence mental well-being. This study aims to identify trends, assess statistical relationships, and establish a baseline solution before implementing predictive models.

For Milestone 1, we apply statistical methods such as descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, and non-parametric estimation to investigate potential correlations between work-related stressors and mental health.

This baseline analysis will inform future improvements in Milestone 2, where deeper statistical modeling or alternative methodologies will be explored.

Methodology

To analyze the dataset, I applied several statistical tests:

1-Chi-Square Test → To examine associations between categorical workplace factors and mental health indicators.
2-Mann-Whitney U Test → To compare distributions of coping struggles and social weakness between employees who received mental health treatment and those who did not.
3-Spearman Correlation → To measure relationships between stress levels, time spent indoors, and social behavior.
